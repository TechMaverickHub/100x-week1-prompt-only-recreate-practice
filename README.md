# 100x Week 1 â€” Prompting Practice (ComfyUI)

Practice set for the 100x Cohort (Week 1): recreate given images by **prompting only**. No ControlNet, no img2img â€” just trial and error with text prompts and model/checkpoint choices.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Recreate target/reference images using only **prompt engineering**.  
- Experiment with **different checkpoints, paramters, and samplers**.  
- Refine prompts iteratively through trial and error.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Layout
- `references/` â†’ target images to be recreated  
- `outputs/` â†’ generated results  
- `prompts/` â†’ prompt drafts and final versions  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open ComfyUI.  
2. Load a **base checkpoint** (e.g., SD 1.5, SDXL, or custom).  
3. Write prompts in `prompts/` and run generations.  
4. Compare outputs to `references/`.  
5. Save best results to `outputs/`

## âœ… Checklist
- [ ] Add reference images  
- [ ] At least 3 recreated outputs per reference  
- [ ] Prompts saved in `prompts/`  
- [ ] Output updated
